# mabl Step Library

The mabl step library is a public step of steps that populate as no-code steps in the trainer. Steps added will display immediately in the trainer and would be available for anyone to use.

## manifest.json

The manifest.json file stores the information required to display the steps in a no-code format. Even if a snippet is added to this repo, until the manifest is updated, the snippet will not be shown to users.
